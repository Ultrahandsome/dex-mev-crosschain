# dex-mev-crosschain

We selected these datasets (Swaps, Price Series, Cross-chain Spread/Cost, Liquidity Profile, Aave Liquidations, MEV Detection, Staking Returns, Spot Price) because they capture the core dimensions of DeFi market activity:
Market behavior: swaps, price series, cross-chain spreads → reveal supply/demand balance and market efficiency.
Liquidity distribution: Uniswap v3 profiles → show how LPs concentrate or diversify their capital.
Risk events: Aave liquidations → highlight leverage fragility and liquidation timing.
Arbitrage & MEV: cross-chain or cross-pool spreads, sandwich detection → indicate hidden costs and market inefficiencies.
Yield side: staking (Lido) → baseline return profile for ETH holders.

By combining these dimensions, we can evaluate trading opportunities, systemic risks, and capital efficiency.
